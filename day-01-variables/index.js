// learn how to create/initialize a variable in js
// and give it a value

let variable = "hello";

// a variable can be reassigned without using let

variable = "worlds";

// this is an uninitialized variable in js

let variableTwo;

// you can also reassign a variable like so

variableTwo = variable;

// this is how you can log your variables

console.log(variable);
console.log(variableTwo);

// an unitialized variable logs the data type undefined
let variableThree;

console.log(variableThree);

// we learn about assigning number values

let number = 1;

// we can also log calculations like

console.log(number + 10);

// this is an array, arrays hold values or elements inside square brackets.
// the values/elements are seperated by commas

let array = ["This", "is", "an", "array"];

// to log an array you need to access the index of the array
// the index is basically the position of the value starting from 0

console.log(array[0]);
